# Some info
- This project was created for the Papersane club of Tran Dai Nghia High School for the Gifted. The initial version was challenging as I had to learn React from scratch, making maintenance and feature additions impossible. It was originally part of another project, but I split it into its own repo, with backend SQL added to store books and articles data in an online database.
- "frontend - Old" folder is an attempt of recreating the site with ShadCN for educational purposes. It was too hard for me. (Finding out-of-the-box components on various ShadCN's extensions was difficult, and sometimes it would be put at unwanted places and I couldn't debug it)
- The articles were written by Papersane club of Tran Dai Nghia High School for the Gifted
- Book reviews were written by a friend of mine
